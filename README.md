# Apple Design Challenge
## Welcome to my Apple design challenge repository!

I've stored my CAD model as a .step file and have a copy of my presentation. This was made for the quarter design challenge, which asked to bend a quarter in half.

Model built using Autodesk Fusion 360. Presentation made using Keynote.
